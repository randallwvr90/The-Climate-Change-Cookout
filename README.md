## Description
An art installation which consists of four components

### 1. Greenhouse gas calculator

Two modes are planned for the greenhouse gas calculator:  one with primarily physical devices and the other with a computer implementation.  The computer implementation will underlie both implementations and will be created first.

Primary Phyisical Devices

A greenhouse gas calculator which responds to visitor selections by playing drums and music, while adjusting lighting.  

The greenhouse gas calculator will run from a Java program and will encorporate greenhouse gas calculators from U.S. EPA, and MyClimate.org. Mechanical devices will interact with the computer to input choices (the toys) and the output will register as images on a computer display and responses from robotic drums, recorded music, and lighting effects.

Computer Implementation

When no visitors are present or the physical devices are not used, the installation will be mostly silent. At random times, a selection of small snippets of drum, music, voice recordings, and lights will perform.   Greenhouse gas calculations will be made for random activities and the results voiced through computer-generated speach.

### 2. Phisical interactive structure (if used)


A physical implementation consisting of a greenhouse, bonfire (non-burning), toys (for user input), and blow-mold snowpersons.

How can the physical implementation interact with the greenhouse gas calculator: inputs? outputs?


### 3. Video component

A video projector/monitor which shows climate change images and video.

Videos are being collected to which we have copyright ownership. Those along with still images (again with our ownership) will play on a video projector/computer screen, depending on venue. These will be displayed via projector or smart TV, depending on capibility of exhibition space.


### 4. Drawings and Prints

Drawings and prints will alternate with each other as wall art.

Satirical drawings of snow(hu)mans mostly ignoring evidence of climate change: see Brooklyn Art Library, Sketchbook Project #15, “The Climate Change Cookout,” call number 375.47-1 for examples.

Prints are in progress that will show skies above small strips of landscape.  Climate-related text will be overprinted.  

The satiric drawings will be variants on "The Climate Change Denier"--a snowman roasting marshmallows over a bonfire. They will be enhanced with printouts of cover pages of journal articles announcing climate change discovery.  These drawings will form the basis of exhibition proposals for all or parts of the installation.
