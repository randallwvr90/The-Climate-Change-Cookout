# The-Climate-Change-Cookout


An art installation which consists of four components

1.	A greenhouse gas calculator which responds to visitor selections by playing drums and music, while adjusting lighting.

The greenhouse gas calculator will run from a Java program and will encorporate greenhouse gas calculators from U.S. EPA, and MyClimate.org. Mechanical devices will interact with the computer to input choices (the toys) and the output will register as images on a computer display and responses from robotic drums, recorded music, and lighting effects.

When no visitors are present, the installation will be mostly silent. At random times, small snippets of drum, music, voice recordings, and lights will perform.


2.	A physical implementation consisting of a greenhouse, bonfire (non-burning), toys (for selections), and blow-mold snowpersons.
How can the physical implementation interact with the greenhouse gas calculator: inputs? outputs?


3.	A video projector/monitor which shows climate change images.

Videos are being collected to which we have copyright ownership. Those along with still images (again with our ownership) will play on a video projector/computer screen, depending on venue. (Locust Projects has a projector on the ceiling.)

4.	Satirical drawings of snow(hu)mans mostly ignoring evidence of climate change: see Brooklyn Art Library, Sketchbook Project #15, “The Climate Change Cookout,” call number 375.47-1 for examples.

The satiric drawings will be variants on "The Climate Change Denier"--a snowman roasting marshmallows over a bonfire. They will be enhanced with printouts of cover pages of journal articles announcing climate change discovery.  These drawings will form the basis of exhibition proposals for all or parts of the installation.
