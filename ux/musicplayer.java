**** This Java class will handle playing music files. ****

	What kind of methods does it need?
	- play_music_file
	- set_music_file
		- determines the music file that will play. 
		- we can have different music files for different greenhouse gas calculations
		- the music probably needs to fade out and back in to keep it sounding good instead of an instant changeover of the music
